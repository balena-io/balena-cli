# Expected Behavior

Please describe what you were expecting to happen. If applicable, please add links to
documentation you were following, or to projects that you were trying to push/build.

# Actual Behavior

Please describe what actually happened instead:
* Quoting logs and error message is useful. If possible, quote the **full** output of the
  CLI, not just the error message.
* Please quote the **full command line** too. Sometimes users report that they were
  "pushing" or "building" a project, but there are several ways to do so and several
  possible "targets" such as balenaCloud, openBalena, local balenaOS device, etc.
  Examples:

```
balena push myFleet
balena push 192.168.0.12
balena deploy myFleet
balena deploy myFleet --build
balena build . -f myFleet
balena build . -A armv7hf -d raspberrypi3
```

Each of the above command lines executes different code behind the scenes, so quoting the
full command line is very helpful.

Running the CLI in debug mode (`--debug` flag or `DEBUG=1` environment variable) may reveal
additional information. The `--logs` option reveals additional information for the commands:

```
balena build . --logs
balena deploy myFleet --build --logs
```

# Steps to Reproduce the Problem

This is the most important and helpful part of a bug report. If we cannot reproduce the
problem, it is difficult to tell what the fix should be, or whether code changes have
fixed it.
