                Previously the timestamp was changing each time which meant the

                were identical. Changing this to a fixed timestamp avoids that
                change

                such that only the contents matter.

        table.

        The cli cannot properly handle this operations on all models and this
        one was inconsistent.

        For now we recommend that users that require parsing the CLI output use
        the output json format and do any kind of necessary parsing on it.

      body: |
        This is an improvement over the scan, join and leave commands removing flakiness when searching over different networks. In short, instead of leaving bonjour to search across all interfaces, we forcebly conduct a search on each interface, this requires mDNS binding any ipv4 interface (0.0.0.0), otherwise it would bind over the interface itself, which is not desired as it causes services to only be able to receive information over that interface, see [mafintosh/multicast-dns#53](https://github.com/mafintosh/multicast-dns/issues/53). This targeted approach enhances the reliability and accuracy of network searches, reducing instances of missed connections or network errors typically caused by flakiness when relying on bonjour's default behavior.

        Instead of using the more generic resin-discoverable-services lib which

        and currently has several vulnerabilities and forks for fixing issues
        (that were later on fixed upstream)

        we directly talk with mDNS using standard (and currently mantained)
        bonjour-service.

        Pluralize command categories, eg. "Device" -> "Devices”.


        Results in much fewer categories in our docs pages and we no longer have
        the somewhat silly separate singular and plural categories for commands
        such as `devices` and `device <command>`.

      hash: 8d6a621bfb62147ed0a88f58057e38211e82f841
      body: >
        When constructing the target state after a reported change from
        livepush, the

        handler function would not pass all build tasks to the function that

        constructs the target state, causing a TypeError when trying to obtain

        the target image name for each service. This updates the handler to pass

        all build tasks, ensuring the information is available to construct the

        target state.

                                responses, since (very rarely)

                                servers send slightly invalid gzip responses
                                that are still accepted

                                by common browsers.


                                Always using Z_SYNC_FLUSH is what cURL does.

                                responses, since (very rarely)

                                servers send slightly invalid gzip responses
                                that are still accepted

                                by common browsers.


                                Always using Z_SYNC_FLUSH is what cURL does.

                        Be more lenient with decoding compressed responses,

                        servers send slightly invalid gzip responses that are
                        still accepted

                        by common browsers.


                        Always using Z_SYNC_FLUSH is what cURL does.

                        this would mean the UI nginx would respond with
                        the page not found page, and that content would
                        have ended up being saved as the token.

                Node 12 may well still work with the SDK for
                quite a while, but we'll no longer actively test
                against them since they are now
                characterized as EOL, and it's quite possible
                that it may stop working entirely in any future
                release.

        The macos-11 runners apparently do not support zst compression format as
        added in flowzone 4.7.2. While support is rolled out, we can keep
        the flowzone branch to the previous working version.

      hash: cd19845b6b6ddecbf723b0598b9fbb628dd2419f
      body: |
        On local push, the CLI uses `localrelease` as the `commit` property for
        the development application. This is not a valid uuid and will not be
        read properly by the supervisor, as seen in

        https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/blob/master/src/compose/service.ts#L652

        While this is not a problem right now, the commit is becoming the main
        way to identify a service release (replacing `releaseId` and `imageId`),
        and the invalid release uuid could cause update issues when pushing a
        local release on when using some API endpoints.

        There is not a lot of benefit to using `.nvmrc` as it still requires
        `nvm use`, and not everybody uses `nvm`. The call to `npm install` will
        already warn about using the wrong version.

                The Radxa boards use different flashing mechanisms

                actual procedure for entering this mode is detailed
                in the contract partials for each device.

      body: |
        When using livepush, the CLI parses the build logs to obtain the stage
        image ids, which are necessary for properly running livepush.

        This process used to store the full log output in memory before parsing
        the logs for obtaining the stage ids. We have seen this cause issues
        before because of the excessive memory usage and it is one the suspects
        of #2165, which is blocking the update to Node 14

        Devices with a v13+ supervisor will fail to start preloaded apps with a
        v2 target state format if connectivity is not available since migration
        of apps.json is not possible without API access.

        This enables support for preloading v3 target state format in
        images with supervisor v13 or above.

                Using build instead of pull allows to add metadata (e.g. labels)
                to pulled images in an

                atomic way. This commit adds the `DockerProgres.build()` method
                to

                build an image from a remote (or local) source and track the
                progress of

                the build.

                        Setting a 3-digit semver to the release.semver field
                        is the suggested approach, instead of setting the
                        release.release_version field. This fixes the unique
                        constraint issue that release_version was often
                        causing to users, since in case a duplicate semver is
                        provided, the backend will auto-increment the
                        revision field of the release. A composite
                        release.version field is also added, which has a raw
                        field with the complete unique version of the release.

      hash: b2d932afabb9c1ca131c0839397d0492f2f1a272
      body: |
        Replace deprecated `rawVersion` and `formattedVersion` fields and use
        alternative overload of `getAvailableOsVersions`. As a result, the word
        'recommended' is no longer printed next to any OS versions.

                Node 10 may well still work with the SDK for quite a
                while, but we'll no longer actively test against them
                since they are now characterized as EOL, and it's
                quite possible that it may stop working entirely in any
                future release.

    - subject: Improve directory scan speed prior to tarballing
      hash: 257dd514ed7c0f6988b8a47219991cc4f61b4529
      body: >
        This changes improves the speed that the project is tarballed by
        switching from

        `klaw` to `recursive-fs` and not running `lstat` on files that are
        ignored.

        Whilst testing with the Jellyfish repository, which contains a number of

        sub directories, each with their own node_modules folder, I was able to

        reduce the time taken to scan and tarball the project from 70s to 11s,

        which is a massive improvement.

    - subject: Set the correct target state when using Compose "image" field

      body: >
        Fixes #2394


        When pushing to a device in local mode, if a service is not external,
        and uses

        an `image` field, that value should be used for tags and target state,
        otherwise

        it won't match the image name generated on the device by balenaEngine.

      body: |
        This allows project files to define services from generic fragments by leveraging YAML's anchors and aliases. See here for an example: https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/43f6537b2c8f01b6d3f0e184d13a0f3cb93d38d7/spec.md#fragments

        Removing the FAILSAFE_SCHEMA flag is not expected to break existing project files, since the default behaviour is more liberal, or cause problems down the road given we perform validation immediately after. Docs for the flag: https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml#load-string---options-

                This was only caught when we started correctly naming
                the preload container by switching from `Name` to `name` in
                our createContainer options.

                Previously we were creating two containers but they had unique
                random names so we never saw the conflict.

                        Be more lenient with decoding compressed responses,
                        since (very rarely)

                        servers send slightly invalid gzip responses that are
                        still accepted

                        by common browsers.


                        Always using Z_SYNC_FLUSH is what cURL does.

      hash: 7f6738c73cd36cdfce0726c4eadbf51fecaebdc1
      body: |
        By forcing the zlib flush mode to Z_NO_FLUSH we are more likely to
        see an error on image download pipelines vs silent failure and
        incomplete files.

        This is part of a larger investigation and may be removed in the
        future when the root cause of the pipeline failures are identified.

        Before this commit, `balena build` and `balena deploy` would almost
        never respect CTRL-C on Windows (PowerShell, cmd.exe). Now CTRL-C
        is respected over a large extent of runtime and, if CTRL-C is hit
        while images are being uploaded (`balena deploy`), the release status
        is correctly set to 'failed'.

        This change allows use of a contract and release semver when doing a
        push,

        and is part of the larger feature to use the builder as part of a CI/CD

                Setting a 3-digit semver to the release.semver field
                is the suggested approach, instead of setting the
                release.release_version field. This fixes the unique
                constraint issue that release_version was often
                causing to users, since in case a duplicate semver is
                provided, the backend will auto-increment the
                revision field of the release. A composite
                release.version field is also added, which has a raw
                field with the complete unique version of the release.

        - Add fleet(s) commands and -f, --fleet flags as aliases to the app(s)
          commands and -a, --app, --application flags.
        - Conditionally rename column/row headers and JSON object properties
          from 'application' to 'fleet', with some variations.
        - Print warning messages regarding the renaming, provided that stderr
          is attached to an interactive terminal.

        * Add missing fast-boot `stop()` call on CLI exit to avoid 1s timeout.
        * Move `.fast-boot.json` to `~/.balena/cli-module-cache.json` to
        address scenarios where the CLI is installed to a read-only folder:
        - pkg's internal 'snapshot' filesystem (standalone zip package)
        - Root-owned folder without write permission to regular users,
          like `/usr[/local]/lib/balena-cli` (the case of caxa-based
          installers or the GUI installer for macOS).

      hash: 501882fd26bbe729754e2452819f8d472a91b439
      body: >
        When configuring a BalenaOS image with system connections using the CLI,

        the function assumed that the boot partition was always 1. This is not

        the case for every supported board. Therefore, a new function is added,

        which automatically determines the boot partition number and allows

        users to configure the image with system connection settings.


        This change affects both the `balena local configure` and `balena os
        configure` commands.

      body: >
        The `local` logging driver captures output from container’s
        stdout/stderr

        and writes them to an internal storage that is optimized for performance
        and disk use.


        We also want to capture these logs on startup to wait for
        success/failure.


        Advise the use of `--privileged` when running Docker-in-Docker to avoid

        various permissions issues encountered in testing.

      body: |
        QEMU v5 has quite a few improvements over v4, and the speed
        difference when emulating arm is quite noticible.

        We tested this with, and without, our single-core limitation
        patch and have not been able to reproduce the stability
        issues we were seeing in v4 so the patch was removed in
        this release.

              hash: 08dde2331405f29c8789bb2523a8e7fc574ba373
              body: |
                Used the NoInfer helper to prevent TS from using the
                old pine.get overloads, unless the generic
                parameters are explicitely provided. This way when
                no generic arguments are provided TS will try to
                match only the fully typed variants and in case of an
                error it will output the reason from those overloads.
                Previously it would fallback to the old pine.get
                variants and try to infer a loose generic type, which
                wasn't correct and silenced some errors This is a bit
                aggressive change and as a result I decided to limit
                this change for the strict pine variant, which is opt-in,
                and hold it back from the main typings until the next
                major.

                This is still in beta as not all deployment environments of
                balena easily support hostapps. Once we have resolved that issue
                we can move to hostapps-only model for serving OS releases.

                        Dtslint's $ExpectType on TS 3.9.6 stopped expanding
                        PineExpandableProps<Release> to the exact
                        properties, which broke the tests. Stopped using
                        $ExpectType in favor of using ts-toolbelt's Equals
                        on a plain assignment. This also makes it easier to
                        completely drop dtslint in a future PR, in favor of
                        plain tsc using @ts-expect-error.

              body: |
                Dtslint's $ExpectType on TS 3.9.6 stopped expanding
                PineExpandableProps<Release> to the exact
                properties, which broke the tests. Stopped using
                $ExpectType in favor of using ts-toolbelt's Equals
                on a plain assignment. This also makes it easier to
                completely drop dtslint in a future PR, in favor of
                plain tsc using @ts-expect-error.

        Depends on open-balena adding the mac_address &
        the overall_status device fields, but the latest cli
        version is probably already not working, since some
        of its dependencies already use the v14 SDK which
        needs the v6 model, that the open-balena-api doesn't
        have yet either.

                The latest resin-lint doesn't work on node 6, which is
                EOL. In the next major release we will also change
                the engines field of the package.json and the node
                typings.

                Having autorebase enabled could lead to having
                more then one instances of the sdk tests running in
                parallel, which will result all of them failing, b/c they
                will use the same test user, and will also add
                unnecessary load to the API. Once we get #582 fixed
                we can remove this.

            - subject: Allow retrieving applications by application case insensitive slug
              hash: d3d97a37409af2186a02f39a7c63c75258693dec
              body: |
                This allows users to disambiguate shared
                applications that have the same name in a more
                user friendly way than using the application id.
                The application slug equals
                `${owner}/${app_name}`.toLowerCase() on the
                cloud api and it's just app_name.toLowerCase() in
                open balena, so we can be sure that the $or will
                never return more than one items when a slug is
                provided.

        The sdk version in the shrinkwrap already
        supports setting tags by commit hashes and as a
        result this already works in the cli as of v11.9.6.
        This PR just adds some docs and some extra
        handling when the commit param prefix is all
        numeric.

      hash: 05cb89725e2e53aae4686905c02f4d4a4c67e691
      body: |
        * sudo shell arguments required escaping for 'os initialize'
        * sudo was not working for standalone zip packages (incorrect
          Node.js path in argv[0])
        * Interactive 'join' and 'leave' not working on Windows because
          'windosu' does not capture stderr.

        E.g. "balena build -e -h <IP> -p 2375" with the CLI running on a Mac
        laptop,

        using balenaEngine on an Intel NUC device, building an image for the RPi
        (ARM

        image arch). Previously, QEMU setup by the CLI assumed that docker ran
        on the

        same OS as the CLI (Docker for Mac has built-in binfmt_misc support and
        does

        not require additional setup, but balenaEngine on Linux requires
        explicit QEMU

        setup.)

    - subject: Implement full command testing, beginning with "balena version"
      hash: 4d389bb6ccbfb7774e94d151fc8063a35031aba9
      body: |
        This also modifies the core CLI to be fed command programatically, which
        is useful for being able to do thing like mock endpoints with tools like
        "nock", and provide an easier debugging experience.
        The tests utilise a "runCommand" helper that intercepts and captures
        stdout/stderr writes and returns them once the command has finished
        running. At this point the test implementation can parse the
        stdout/stderr logs and assess nock interceptions to determine if the
        command ran correctly.
        This change also homogenises debug messages to start with `[debug]`,
        however this is not strictly enforced by linting rules.

        The error appears to happen when symlinking typing files and manifests
        on case sensitive file systems (like windows) with the error:
        ```
        lib/actions-oclif/env/add.ts(73,16): error TS2742: The inferred type of 'flags' cannot be named without a reference to '../../../../../../../../../volumes/live/c64feead-f78e-4bd4-742d-ccd29aef53c4/volume/node_modules/@oclif/parser/lib/flags'. This is likely not portable. A type annotation is necessary.
        lib/actions-oclif/version.ts(42,16): error TS2742: The inferred type of 'flags' cannot be named without a reference to '../../../../../../../../volumes/live/c64feead-f78e-4bd4-742d-ccd29aef53c4/volume/node_modules/@oclif/parser/lib/flags.js'. This is likely not portable. A type annotation is necessary.
        ```

        This appears to be reported on the Typescript repo here https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/29221
        The suggested workaround is to explicitly set the type of the `flags` static
        property.

        Both the tunnel and SSH commands require a full UUID for an online
        device. A single code path was added to provide this, taking either
        an application name or a partial UUID as a search parameter.
        In the event of an application name being provided, a device select
        form is presented to the user to pick from the online devices at that

        The suggestion happens if the UUID supplied is not found. Because
        of that function, it's impossible to do an atomic connect to a device
        in non-interactive mode. The auto-suggestion results connecting to
        the first available device, which is likely not the intended action.
        The current workaround is running a `balena device UUID` and check
        its exit code before running `balena ssh UUID`, but since these
        are independent steps, still can connect to another device, if between
        the two commands anything changes. With this flag used, one could never
        connect accidentally to the wrong device due to suggestions.

        `version` used to be optional but it seems we recently had to make it a
        required parameter. However it really feels redundant when all it’s used
        for is to determine whether the command should issue a legacy user API
        key or a provisioning key.

        This makes version optional but tries to figure it out by itself by
        reading os-release from the image's boot partition. This is not
        foul-proof however, and while it'll work with most recent images it
        won't work with all and in that case it'll bail out and only then warn
        the user to specify it via the --version argument.

        The push command was relying on the output from the builder to indicate
        the build status, but this isn't helpful for CI. This commit makes the
        remote build module respect the `isError` flag which the builder sends
        in any errors. Any errors which come from the builder indicate the
        release will not be deployed.

        Currently running the tests is painfully slow, this commit adds a task
        which will run the bare minimum build, and then the tests, speeding up
        the process by an order of magnitude.
        I had to repeat `gulp test`, instead of reusing `npm run test`, so that
        the pretest task isn't ran too.

        These files are not supported by any other part of the resin
        infrastructure, and it could cause confusion with it not being
        supported everywhere. The idea was originally added because we
        thought we might need to make extensions on docker-compose, but
        that hasn't happened.

      subject: Improve `selectFromList` function signature to be much more reusable
    - author: Akis Kesoglou
      body: >-
        Both commands work with local devices by remotely invoking the
        `os-config` executable via SSH. This requires an as of yet unreleased
        resinOS (that will most likely be v2.14) and the commands ascertain
        compatibility merely by looking for the `os-config` executable in the
        device, and bail out if it’s not present.

        `join` and `leave` accept a couple of optional arguments and implement a
        wizard-style interface if these are not given. They allow to
        interactively select the device and the application to promote to. If
        the user has no apps, `join` will offer the user to create one. `join`
        will also offer the user to login or create an account if they’re not
        logged in already without exiting the wizard.

        `resin-sync` (that's used internally to discover local devices) requires
        admin privileges. If no device has been specified as an argument, the
        commands will launch the device scanning process in a privileged
        subprocess via two new internal commands: `internal sudo` and `internal
        scanDevices`. This avoids having the user to invoke the commands with
        sudo and only request escalation if truly needed. This commit also
        removes the dependency to “president”, implementing “sudo” functionality
        within the CLI.

        This mostly reverts the removal of the legacy deploy code that pushed
        image tars via the builder. It’s needed for users to avoid having to
        switch between CLI versions in order to push to legacy apps as well.

        Note: this pins resin-sdk to 9.0.0-beta14 as I couldn’t get it to
        install otherwise — npm would always install 9.0.0-beta9 instead.

        New version is 3.1.0.

        The updated version is not backwards compatible as it removes all *Async
        methods that are in wide use in the CLI. The workaround for now is to
        manually promisify the client and replace all `new Docker()` calls with
        a shared function that returns a promisified client.

        Legacy behaviour is mostly retained. The most notable change in
        behaviour is that invoking `resin deploy` without options is now allowed
        (see help string how it behaves).

        In this commit there are also the following notable changes:

        - Deploy/Build are promoted to primary commands

        - Extracts QEMU-related code to a new file

        - Adds a utility file to retrieve the CLI version and its parts

        - Adds a helper that can be used to manipulate display on capable
        clients

        - Declares several new dependencies. Most are already indirectly
        installed via some dependency

        This PR adds functionality to `resin sync` to try to infer what the
        device uuid is as follows:
        - If the argument to `resin sync` is an app, get all the devices from
        that application. If there is only one, auto-select it, otherwise show
        an interactive drive selection widget.
        - If the argument to `resin sync` is a uuid, use it directly, without
        trying to infer anything.
        - If no argument is passed to `resin sync`, display an interactive
        selection widget showing all your devices from all your applications.

      body: |-
        This commit adds the ability to run a Docker build for an architecture
        which is not the host architecture, using qemu-linux-user. Currently
        this is only supported for linux.
        Added:
        * Installation of qemu which supports propagated execve flags
        * Copying of qemu binary into the build context
        * Transposing the given Dockerfile to use the qemu binary
        * Intercepting of the build stream, so the output looks *almost* exactly
        the same.

        Nocache and tagging of images is also supported.
        Using `resin deploy` a user can now deploy an image to their fleet. The
        image can either be built by `resin-cli`, plain Docker, or from a remote
        source.
